welcome to world of gas a show for data  enthusiasts i'm your host warren hoffman ceo

hello fellow data nerds my guest today is will  marshall will is the co-founder and ceo of planet  

a company that owns and operates hundreds of  satellites that produces images of the earth  

planet has over 100 million in revenue and from  over 600 customers will welcome to world of das  

hey pleased to be here awesome awesome now  planet first launched its satellites in 2014  

and within four years you were collecting  images basically from the entire world  

to me this seems like incredibly fast like what's  the non-obvious thing that made this possible  

well i would say the answer to that question is  at agile aerospace uh we we uh agile okay what's  

agile aerospace i'm just gonna tell you it's  perfect okay so what software companies you know   you've probably heard of software agile software  which is yup you know the release early release  

often test out the software with customers or you  know in a sandbox and then iterate as quickly as  

possible um and that leads to fast development um  and and we've done the same with with aerospace  

so um we over the last five years we've averaged  four launches a year so roughly every three months  

or so they don't often spread out evenly  like that but roughly every three months   on average we've got a new launch and we put  up a next generation of satellites in each one  

every time how many selects per launch that go  in per launch ranges from a couple to 88 was uh  

oh my gosh which is was the world record that  one but definitely think about it 20. and  

when we launched 20 we put up two that have a  next generation sensor or a next generation radio  

or an expiration hard drive or a next generation  and then you're testing it out and seeing if it  

following works will be made of all of those  satellites also on the software domain we're   constantly updating ourselves i mean you'll  be surprised we have interns that come to  

us our company and we give them the keys  to the satellites and they're like what   we're like okay just don't upload  software to all of them at once  

and brick them all because they'll be annoying  but generally i mean we've got lots of fail saves   actually it makes it it's pretty hard to break  ourselves but you know unlike something on the  

ground you can't go up and press the reset button  so there are certain processes but generally we  

we iterate the software on board really rapidly  too every week we're uploading new software and   so it making them more efficient both in terms of  their operations and and also and eventually doing  

processing of the imagery up there so you can  imagine how we you know increasingly turning space  

more like the software domain and certainly  uh most importantly bringing space um up to  

date with moore's law so you know taking all the  latest generation in the electronics so in your  

phones and in your computer and other consumer  electronics and putting that in and and by doing  

that keeping space strapped to moore's law  as i call it so if you have 400 satellites  

up there somewhere like they actually could  be 400 different satellites with slightly   different software and different components  and different and they're as you guys are and  

they're just keep keep iterating to get better  and better is that right yeah sure i mean we do  

it in in fleet so yeah maybe a bit more like  uh if you get a few hundred people together   they have slightly different models of iphones in  their pocket or android phones but but yes sure  

um there are different models then and it's our  job to make it sure it's backwards compatible so   if you ever use data from our first satellites  you can use it from the latest satellites but  

it's also our job to constantly iterate and again  just like you don't want a three-year-old phone   in your pocket you don't want a three-year-old  satellite in space because it becomes obsolete  

you know our next generation satellites that we  launched last year produced five times more data   than the previous generation you know than a  per day per satellite roughly the same cost  

so our job is to make more capability in that  box okay that makes sense now i see planet as a  
Planet as a data company

data company not an analytics company and not a  space company right i i i think i see your data  

as kind of these persistent images of the earth  and then of course you have this proprietary way  

of getting the data you launch satellites  and do you see it similar or did you see   it become a different way of of describing planet  as a company no exactly the same oh all right  

um and and look we of course have satellites  and we're satellite company we're of course  

a data company and we're also a software company  um you know we built a lot of software to process   all the data but the most important thing is that  we service data to our clients so you know um  

we service imagery and analytics they are  on to agriculture clients we service that to  

mapping clients we service that to government  clients because that's what our consumers and   our clients use right they don't buy satellites  they they don't buy software they buy data and  

analytics feeds i actually liken it to bloomberg  bloomberg terminal you know services is data  

uh for financial services of course uh the only  difference in and you know the great thing about  

bloomberg is that it's high margins high growth  because the margins are high because you sell   at a data feed a second time amount of costs are  very very low um and it's high stickiness you know  

because your data is embedded into their workflow  the only difference is too far one is uh we have a  

proprietary data set bloomberg mainly aggregates  public source financial data we are uh uh you  

know we obviously have a unique 200 satellite  fleet that images the whole planet every day   that's a unique data set not only is it hard to  get that data set because you have to launch 100  

but it's impossible as far as i'm aware and i'm  a physicist and i spent some time thinking about   this you can't go back in time you can collect you  know yeah a few years of data even if you erect  

that system and actually that's archive of data  is what enables us to build the machine learning   on top which is incredibly important for our  analytics and the second difference with bloomberg  

is that we service many different vertical markets  right so uh bloomberg maintenance agriculture you  

shouldn't be here exactly okay and so we think of  it bloomberg plus plus but bloomberg is a good way  

of thinking about it people do get confused about  our business model they would get very excited   about the satellites to your point like yeah  we're really a data company i when people do get  

confused about that i say if you think of planet  as a satellite company then you you should think   of google as a server company yes yes because yes  they have lots of servers and that's the hardware  

backend but just like servers are back into google  uh satellites are back into us now our satellites  

are a little bit more sexy than google's uh  servers so people do get excited about them   i do too i'm a space geek but um in the end the  services are data service so we're much more like  

a bloomberg if i'm a data consumer let's say i'm  a data scientist well the heart one of the hard  
Customer sophistication

things about using imagery data is that the data  is very very very large how's the sophistication  

of your customers evolved over the last few years  to use that type of data that's a great question i  

mean actually this is a really fascinating point i  mean we have yeah 25 terabytes a day of imagery uh  

over three or four million images a day from  the satellites um it's a vast data set right

and and most uh you know we we think of that  all this value you know starting and helping  

people recover from floods in germany right now  or you know like people uh using it for security  

and finding out new threats like where's all  these fleets of ships uh protecting coral reefs  

you know improving agriculture but if if  i'm real a lot of those users can't yet  

get value from the data because it's so much um  it actually you know so google gets value of it  

out of it for maps because they have sophisticated  you know geospatial teams um big ag companies get  

value out of it because they know how to process  satellite imagery um the governments get value out  

of it because they have big teams doing that  but you know the small insurance company the   little hedge fund the you know the the developer  can't and and so we're working hard to build the  

analytics to go up the stack to help them you  know we just hired kevin wheel who's uh a head of  

product amazing guy yeah yeah thank you he's  been friend for a long time yeah and he he he   he lets a product for twitter and then instagram  and at twitter he uses an analogy that they had  

the state of firehose the twitter firehose right  yep and they were selling it to people and they   thought this was the best thing since sliced bread  and yes like once again google got value out of it  

certain government's got value data yeah can't get  value out of 500 million tweets a day in a hundred  

different languages and so on um and what they  started doing is adding certain analytics like  

okay we'll just tell you how often your brand as a  company is mentioned and the sentiment around that  

brand yeah and then that was something useful to  more people now so somewhat analogously we have a  

fire hose of data coming down from our satellites  um as we add certain analytics many more people  

will be able to provide get access and get value  from that data and so that's what we're building  

so with time i think it will it will move away  from the geospatial expert enterprises to the um  

the folks with just data science and then maybe  to the folks with no not even data science  
Data scientists

but at the same time you're you're adding all  these analytics there does seem to be another   motion going on in a macro environment and  that the these data scientists are becoming  

more and more uh lethal because they have more and  more tools around them so the the data scientists  

today even that may not be able to use your data  just because the the tools around them are getting   so much better and so much more powerful  in three years they may be able to use your  

data and so you you're going to have a larger  group of buyers regardless even if you didn't   go into analytics is that do you see it the same  way definitely i mean look what has happened in  

computer vision over the last uh five uh years  it's in incredible right um computer vision has  

been one of the most successful areas of machine  learning extracting information out of imagery  

um you know it was a lot pioneer for pulling out  cats and dogs from pictures you put on facebook  

or youtube or whatever um but the same technology  underlying those neural networks can be used to  

extract out roads and buildings or ships and  planes or trains or trees whatever it is out  

of our imagery in fact you know i gave a little  ted talk about this but liking it to building  

a bit like google index what's on the internet and  made it searchable we're basically with machine  

learning and computer vision we can extract out  all the objects on in every picture if we do   that for the whole world and do that every day we  basically build up a database where everything is  

on the earth over time amazing and that is then  searchable a bit like google has figured out how   to search the internet we're figuring out how to  search the physical planet and even if you don't  
Competitive market

do that like you could have customers that do  it or partners that do it or right and all these   other okay interesting so and okay now not knowing  that much about your market like if i was going to  

try to create a competitive planet um let's spit  ball for a second like i i would try to maybe  

like incent low-flying planes and drones with a  camera to try to collect data continuously like  

why would my crazy scheme not work okay well um  planes it's tricky because of area coverage so  

planes travel you know a couple hundred miles an  hour or whatever they do um and you know that's  

about a hundred times slower than our satellites  and they cover in if you you look at the swath  

width it would be about ten times less at least  um and so that's a thousand times less imagery per  

day per per plane so to cover the same area you're  gonna have to have you know a hundred thousand  

planes or two hundred thousand planes to cover  the same areas are two hundred satellites yeah   that's a lot of planes that's a lot of then yeah  separately you have to go and get uh permission  

to fly those planes in every jurisdiction  in every county every city every country and  

where north korea is probably not allowing me  to fly my planes there or something like that  

india and many other places and and and whereas  space we are actually outside the territory of  

countries yeah the territorial air space goes up  to 100 kilometers and there after it's space and  

space uh it become it became international law  uh that anyone can fly over anyone's territory  

and take a picture from space it's partly because  of the distance it's partly because you can't very   well fly up to russia and turn left you're in it  you're gonna go over it yeah you know they can't  

just say you can't take a picture that you know  in the us and russia during the cold war said   well okay we'll let each other do that we will  only let each other fly planes and then it became  

international law that anyone can fly a satellite  that also means north korea could in principle   fly a satellite over the u.s right and there's  nothing to stop them from doing that um but um  

yes so so we're allowed to do that whereas  your plane idea you would have to go and get   permission from everyone okay got it okay that  does seem quite hard okay um now okay you you  

sell it expensive yeah and then very expensive  good morning you know people it's a funny point   people think well aerial imagery or drones it's  gonna be much cheaper yes the actual cost of the  

drone is cheaper than the cost of the satellite  but when you factor in the area coverage yeah   per unit area our imagery is far cheaper than  collecting it by drones so for example drones  

for agriculture makes no sense to me um in almost  all agricultural cases our resolution suffices  

and enables precision agriculture and you  you know the cost wins because we're much   much lower there are certain applications of  drones for imagery like building sites where  

you need to know brick by brick we haven't got  the resolution so it might make sense to use   drones but you have to think about the application  certainly if it's wide area coverage satellites uh  

pretty good yeah yeah absolutely absolutely okay  well okay then when you sell really valuable data  
Partnering with other companies

but of course there's lots of other data like in  in the geospatial data world like safegraph where  

i work sells geospatial data there's companies  like costar and corelogic that have geospatial   data like how do you see yourself partnering with  these like hundreds of other companies that also  

provide data well i want to collaborate i want to  mix and match our data when you we launched lastly  

our first fusion product data fusion product  uh that married our data with the landsat data  

and the sentinel data from nasa and the european  space center respectively and it gave the sort of   radiometric accuracy of those satellites which are  really really good at radiometric activity like  

how many photons turn into how many electrons oh  my gosh ccd and then to accurately know things  

um and yet with our resolution which is  much better than those systems and temporal  

resolution which is much better and now we have  this color balanced radiometrically accurate  

daily image that's cloud free at  three meter resolution using those   it's one plus one equals three or one plus one  plus one equals five in the scale or something but  

you know like it's always synergistic you get more  value than the sum of the parts so i'm excited  

about you know merging with other geospatial  or even non-geospatial data sets you know   yeah i mean the great thing about combining data  is the value of all the data sets goes up as they  
Working with other companies

get joined together that's why these like join  keys on the data so so now similar question for um  

all these like analytics companies because you're  doing analytics but then there's also companies   like orbital insight there's these companies like  data robot there's even like accenture and booz  

allen like how do you see these companies and  working with these do you see them as partners   do you see them as co-option how does that work  long term i very much see them as partners i can  

imagine an ecosystem of of folks building apps  and services on top of planners uh data i mean  

you know there's thousands of applicants there's  some you know pretty mainstream applications of   our data but there's a long tail and you know  we and each requires bespoke applications  

maybe some novel data industry knowledge and we  need to package them together to service those   vertical markets and we want to work together  with folks that innovate on top of that data  

you know we you know planet is not a monopoly of  all the best ideas yeah and and we wanted to to  

to see that happen uh we work with orbital  insight we work with those companies to   to get access to our data to um enable them to add  value for their users and and and we think it is  

absolutely helping to build the the market um the  market opportunity is huge here yeah you know we  

don't need to go about um thinking about this too  competitively because there's just so much i mean  

you know we see planet as being part of the two  biggest transformations in the global economy the  

transformation to a digital economy and  sustainable economy so digital transformation   is where industries like agriculture where  we improve the crop yield by 20 or 40 percent  

by doing precision agriculture and i can explain  that a bit more in detail if you want but like   every industry big data and ai is hitting them and  they're enabling them to become more efficient and  

20 or 40 percent improvements in in an industry of  those sort of scale whether that's agriculture or  

transportation or forest management or civil  government is huge right yeah so there's a  

multi-trillion dollar transition and then the  transition to a sustainable economy which is   also a multi-trillion dollar transition there's  all the governments and companies of the world  

trying to measure their emissions and measure  their environmental or esg targets they have  

to measure natural capital but basically as a  global economy especially as we're rebooting   out of cover trying to reboot into a sustainable  economy the first thing you have to do is measure  

natural capital we've been presuming it's free  trees are free we can cut them down no one don't   have to pay any tree any money we just cut it  down we you know we assume we can just pollute  

stuff into the atmosphere into the rivers no cost  we and that obviously has to stop it's completely  

unsustainable and it's going to kill us if we  don't but at first one of the benefits of planets   first it kind of has to be measured in a way  exactly that's my point in this digital transition  

and the sustainable transition the first step is  to measure this stuff you cannot manage what you  

don't measure um you just can't and so we have  the data that underpins is pretty foundational  

to helping those two transformations i'm not  saying it's the the be all end or data set that   solves all of those the world's problems but  it's pretty foundational to in assisting those  

two multi-trillion dollar transition so when when  i think about you you are asking about analytics   companies i'm like let's go at it there's so  much let's all yeah okay now okay back your  
Recruiting talent

business like when you and i met we met at your  office a couple of years ago and afterwards i  

i i took a tour of the clean room of like how  you you're building all these satellites and it's  

like it's super cool and then i came out there and  i'm like oh man this is totally unfair like these  

guys have a totally unfair advantage when they're  recruiting people like how has like the coolness   factor helped you like recruit talent yeah they  certainly are it is um space people do love space  

people love space there's no question about it and  across the spectrum it's people in our sales and  

marketing to of course that people are building  yeah and designing the satellites and everyone in   between so um we can't just rely on that i mean  we care about giving fair wages to people it's a  

bit hard to compete with the likes of google  and facebook and apple you know here in the   bay area um but we don't only hire here and and  and uh but we do hire with competitive salaries  

in in in relevant verticals markets and spaces  and and and because we don't take that for granted  

uh we care about our employees um but um but  yeah for sure it's an attractor so we've never  

had a big problem hiring and that hasn't been our  biggest challenge well that's great i mean you're   that's you're probably the only company that  can say that so that's really interesting now  
High fixed costs

data companies um generally have a lot of trouble  attracting let's say a series a series b because  

in the in the beginning the margins look really  bad because it's like you have to do this fixed   cost to get the data that in some ways that  kind of cost shows up in your cogs and then like  

generally you put out now in planet's case like  your startups costs were like way even higher than  

most data companies like what advice would you  give to other companies who have these high fixed  

costs to create core data in like telling that  story well speak to the right venture capitalists  

i mean not many of them understand that right  but but actually to your ghost margins point  

we have very high gross margins correct yeah the  incremental cost of selling that image this to the  

second customer right is like 100 very round very  close to a very round number yeah meaning that um  

you know it's just the compute cost of serving the  uh of that customer it's just almost nothing so  

the irony is yes it costs a lot to put out fixed  costs yeah that's a fixed cost and thereafter  

it's gravy it's it's more gravy than you think  you might go well it's like aws you know these

any particular compute instance can  only be used once whereas an image  

can be distributed to thousands of users  at almost no incremental costs so actually  

it's much better than an aws type situation in  terms of margins data businesses are much better  

i think they're fantastic businesses  you know you can look at it like as   expensive capex or you can look at it  as high barrier to entry and they are  

really really great margins yes you have to find  people that you know there is a story that you  

have to tell in the beginning that people have  to kind of come on board on this vision right  

yep all right interesting no no okay speaking  of data businesses like another data business i   admire zoom info henry shock the co was on world  of das recently and and i noticed that zoom info  
Data businesses

was actually featured in planet's recent investor  presentation now outside of those two companies  

there aren't like a ton of like data companies  that have gone public recently uh what companies  

do you admire what do you learn from what do  you look to to as you're building your business  

well look at um the the the company that i look to  the most is actually bloomberg um i mentioned them  

all right analogy that they you know they're  providing data feeds and and those data feeds are  

powering the customers to make smarter decisions  i think that's what planet is doing fundamentally   it's a very different you know back end but  like the front end actually doesn't look so  

dissimilar and i certainly think the margins  and the growth and the stickiness uh analogous  

now um uh uh that doesn't you know yeah anyway  so there's no perfect analogy and of course they  

didn't recently go public yeah um yeah yeah that's  right right so you know they started 40 years ago  

right yeah right yeah um but uh and that's not  the be all in all of company of course it's just  

a milestone and they chose not to do it that  way but but i i think they're the best company  

for us to admire interesting okay cool now you're  you're student of data businesses we actually  
Resources

met because you sent me a cold email wanting to  discuss the das bible blog that i that i wrote  

not many ceos send cold emails out to like random  bloggers like what other resources have you found  

valuable in helping you create such a successful  data company well apparently yours [Laughter]  

it's i look around i i mainly get advice from  advisors um i mean i had seen your blog i do  

look at you know blogs and try to you read books  and articles about the relevant in but you know to  

you to the point of view many of the things  that you've said the data as a subscription  

service are really rare businesses actually in  comparison with sas everyone knows that everyone  

knows that and you know we have these discussions  in our boardroom about this because people like  

keep on pushing us to that cookie cutter of a sass  because that's what most people know and they know  

it works but actually there's differences with the  uh das companies which is um for example they much  

more lend themselves to be horizontal players  that are relevant to lots of vertical markets   yep um where as sas companies you're more likely  to be in a one person market yeah if you were a  
Similarities and Differences

sas company you would have like a solution for the  agriculture and it would take in all these feeds   and stuff like that and yeah that's exactly right  so there's there's similarities and differences  

and of course i already mentioned you know sort  of um one-to-many is an important feature of das  

models um anyway so i i there are differences  and and i think you know the twilight challenge  

is less a less well trodden path than than  the than the sas there's there's more uh of  

that to follow but i i stick to my guns that  we're primarily a data company we are also a  

software company because as we add analytics  it enables per the early point about going up  

the stack to enable solutions we do grab more  value right and and enable users that wouldn't  

otherwise be able to use it um but in in my  sense the the core value proposition is the data  

and i actually believe that's the case for a lot  of companies but you don't think of it like that   i think google is absolutely a data company i mean  people say it's a search company you can say it's  

a video company you can say it's an ai company you  can say it's a server company to the earlier point   but i would say it's a data company google is  not leading the world because it has the best  

search algorithm not anymore yeah because it  never has the best thing about what everyone wants  

and that data set is unrivalled right and you know  you'll see them open source or their ai technology  

they're not an ai they you know they talk about  being ai fur yeah but they're not an ai company in   the sense that their product isn't ai in fact they  give that away for free which tells you something  

yeah that's not the asset that they think is  most valuable if they thought that was the most   valuable they would not be putting uh tensorflow  and all these modules online yeah and yeah and  
Data is the New Oil

they had their best engineers develop tensorflow  it's like you know jeff dean all these guys like   are developing tensorflow and they're like oh  yeah we'll just give it away for free of course  

the reason is well it doesn't matter they have all  the data they can give it to anyone they wanted   asset is the data the economist data is the new  oil i think there's a challenges with that analogy  

and you know i don't think data is dirty  um also um oil is only one to one you know  

you know you can only put a liter yeah yeah what  does it what's it spend you can't resell it yeah  

yeah however in this in a couple of senses it's a  good analogy one is it powers lots of industries  

right another is you have to refine it before you  can do that you don't just dig it out the ground  

and give it to people and um and it's extremely  valuable it's commoditized and people talk about  

data being commoditized that doesn't mean it loses  its value yes tell the you know the world that the   oil oil is not valuable and you know you're going  to have them last no data is extremely valuable  

even as it gets commoditized um and so i do think  there's analogies data is empowering lots of  

industries just like oil it powers lots of  industries um again do you think compute is  

another a computer i mean you mentioned aws like  is compute a good analogy as well again you can  

only use only one compute instance only one person  can use one compute instance at any one time so no  

i i think data stands on its own and being you  know one to many and not one to one interesting  
Selling into the Government Market

now one things interesting about planet is a lot  of planets left revenues come from government   and um and of course you're lucky when you start  a planet there was already an existing use case  

but i still imagine it's very very difficult  to sell into government what did what's the   secret or what advice would you give to others  who want to sell into the government market  

persistence wanting to sell with the the gov to  the government i mean i think a lot of tech firms  

don't think that they want to they  they'll be bureaucratic or they disagree   with some policy and i actually think that's  the wrong attitude i i think leaning in and  

being a partner the governments are trying to  do services for the citizens yeah and it's our   job to try and help them not just one government  with any government and it's it's it's uh you know  

you know so so persistence and wanting  to work with the government i think is   is important then we just today uh announced that  we're expanding our contract with nasa um it's  

really exciting what we do with them you know we  we provide them data to help monitor what's called  

key climate variables you know the underpinnings  of our climate models so they do a lot of research   on the data like glaciology how fast the  glaciers melting hydrology that's super cool  

so cool well yeah and the announcement today was  about that we were expanding our contract and they  

want to provision our data to everyone that's  a researcher under nsf grant so every research  

there's 280 000 nsf funded researchers and they  will now all be able to get access to our data  

wow that's important for multiple reasons one for  science and ex and advancing our understanding of  

earth systems secondly because they generate  all of our use cases that underpin our clients  

so actually it serves planet very well i mean  nasa's paying for this so that's great for us but  

also just think you know when agriculture wants  to move to understand and leverage satellite data  

they don't just do it on the fly they base  it ultimately based on scientific studies   that show that our data can enable precision  agriculture or sustainable agriculture practices  

that improve their crop yield decrease their  fertilizer use decrease their the the the  

impact on the environment of that uh that and  so it enables them to advance their industry  

same with forestry and forest management and so  academic papers are actually what underpin um our  

business and so this is really great for us but  anyway serving the government is something that we   think it makes a lot of sense is there some like  insanely weird crazy use case that people wouldn't  
Permitting

like appreciate or they wouldn't have been able to  think of you know the agriculture one is kind of   like a really interesting one but i think one that  people would grok and understand um but there may  

be some other like random one that maybe people  would have never thought of before one that's   happening a fair bit now but i wouldn't have  thought about it even just a a year or two ago it  

was is permitting so local governments are using  our data to to uh enable permit enforcement so  

okay so yeah new houses we'll check whether  they've got planning permission and then   send fines to them if they're not or or you  know there's a humboldt county uses our data  

to track marijuana oh god it's legal but  you have to have permits yeah and and they  

they do and there's the classic one of greece  where they uh you know they have attacks for pools  
Speed Cameras

um and they they show that there was way more  pools in athens than people paying taxes for it  

and this interestingly and i was just talking to  a minister about this this morning that the this  

is like the speed cameras for them for permitting  and they don't want to send the person out both  

because it's more expensive but also it makes it  too impersonal and then people try and persuade   you well i just had to have this swimming pool for  this or it just had to have this extra mountain  

or or in certain countries there might be bribes  or other types of things it's a lot easier  

straight to the chase yeah here's your bill in  the mail you were speeding yeah you you built a  

building which you weren't meant to and you know  it's impersonal but it's it's actually efficient   and and and in the end it it it does a job and  i i think that there's gonna be a lot of that  

we we've seen people you know do some incredible  stuff with our data i mean you know we work with  

google on maps and you might think well that's  an obvious application keep maps up to date   but the sophistication of what's behind the  scenes there is insane so they use their cell data  

to figure out if there's a new road or  a building because people are suddenly   driving through a field and they're like what  the heck that automatically triggers a lat long  

task request to our high resolution satellites  that high resolution takes a picture and then   computer vision extracts out the road or that new  building or that new train station or whatever it  

is and then that updates their maps and they do  that tens of thousands of times yeah accordingly  

amazing and it's all humans and not it's  completely automated humans are completely out of  

the loop and that's just that's how your maps stay  online up to date it's just crazy but it's in a  

really sophisticated system so people might think  oh maps get updated but like that's an incredible  

system so yeah there's a few but i mean i think  you know so those are some of the novel ones but  

a lot of it's quite down-to-earth i  mean you know that agricultural use case   on the infrared band we can literally tell crop  type and crop yield in every three by three meter  

pixel of every area of every pharmacy and  you can tell crop type because you can get  

the temperature coming off of it and you can  see a little bit what's under the soil and   there's there's there's other kind of things that  you're getting from different spectrums yeah so  

our near-infrared spectral band basically picks  up um chlorophyll thumb and and we basically can  

measure biomass and if we trend that over time we  can quickly tell the crop time um and then um but  

the scale of it agriculture represents 25 of  the land mass of the earth amazing right so  

you're back to your plane thing really hard to  find planes or drones yeah over all of that we   can fly over all of that every day and enable  the farmer to do more precision agriculture  

every day across all those and the great thing  about some of these spectrum things is when you're   when you're getting imagery if you have clouds  you can't see it that day whereas a lot of these  
Hyperspectral

other types of spectrum stuff you can still get  it through the clouds which is really really nice   well we're getting that way i mean actually  most of our spectral bands can't go through  

the cloud but what we can do is we burn through  the cloud by having really regular frequencies  

right every day yeah we are also we just announced  these hyperspectral satellites um which will have  

400 spectral bands we're going to be launching  them in a in a couple of years here um and they  

will be able to pinpoint um methane and co2 point  source emissions like here's the gas leak here's  

the house they let their gas on here's the waste  facility here's the what have you yeah so again is  
Time of Day

there is there anything on the satellite stuff  where like time of day i know most satellites   they're kind of like the ideal time is let's say  11 a.m to 2 p.m that they want to look at but but  

maybe there may be some interesting things that  are going on at night that are very very different  

about these particular places or something um  is there is there do you think about time of  

day as a kind of a particular variable absolutely  yeah and most of our fleet scans the whole world  

at about 11 a.m local time no matter where you are  so if you're in l.a it's 11 a.m if you're in tokyo  

and that's because they stay fixed with respect  to the sun and the earth rotates underneath it   yeah local time of day plus or minus um and  that's really useful because then you have  

consistent shadow angles and things like that  which enable the machine learning and analytics  

to be much easier so and then but we then also  have we complement that with the skysat system  

that we can zoom in on any particular location  up to 10 times per day uh which is useful um for  

a lot of applications where you need more rapid  revisit so let's dive into specs because like so   you know planet has just because it's such a great  business you have many many different options  
Going Public

um and if you want to go public there's like  eight different ways to go public and you   you chose the spac route why did you chose that  route as opposed to the other ways to potentially  

you know bring liquidity to your shareholders well  firstly we're excited about going public i mean  

that that's the the first thing that motivates  i mean we think the planet is ready to go public  

yep um and the world really needs planet let  me explain that so we're ready to go public we  

you know we've got a mature satellite fleet  producing a unique data set um that is now and  

now we've built a mature business on top of that  over 100 million in revenue last year you've seen   uh it's not something you've been tousing it  but we now it's public knowledge so there it is  

um and uh it's growing in a healthy way and and  and then we've spent the last year preparing  

our executive team and other functions financial  legal and so on to be ready to go public it was   always the right destination for our company and  we were ready then the specs became hot of course  

in recent times and it's an efficient mechanism  to go public and it's one way you can say a little  

bit more about your future and your plans and and  i think that's good that within reason there's   some challenges with sparks and and but we felt  of all the companies that made sense for to use  

that mechanism it was planning and and we were  basically spaknip as one of our board members

pretty much every spec under the sun wanted  to partner with us so we were lucky to have   the choice and we we chose um dmy technologies  because we really loved how they saw the business  

understood us as that data company understood how  we were enabling the sustainability transition  

the digital transformation of the global economy  saw us in that big perspective um had done the  

had done specs before so this is their fourth  one so they're experienced in that process   it's not something to be novice about um and  and and really cared and loved our mission and  

so we felt that was right and then we managed to  attract really great investors into our uh pipe   as well black rock which you know has a big focus  on esg and ensuring their companies care about the  

environment and sustainability and we can actually  help them uh mark benioff is is is putting in a a  

large check and he's excited because he wants to  dedicate 20 years of his next 20 years of his life  

to biodiversity and he's been looking at every  startup under the sun that's doing anything to the   sustainability in the environment and biodiversity  and he said either they are using planet or they  

need planets data basically as he put it all roads  lead to planet when it comes to sustainability  

basically our data enables that sustainability  transformation and we have um companies like  

google coming back existing investors and so  we have a powerful set of actors with us and  

we always like that because we want to build a  company with great investors all right a couple  
Learning from NASA

couple of personal questions for you now before  planet you were you were an accomplished scientist   at nasa what are things that one could only really  learn from working at nasa systems engineering  

okay what do you mean by that that is uh the  putting together a really complicated product  

projects that take planning require thinking  about requirements um thinking about how all  

the systems interlock so any one of the subsystems  of our satellite is a really complicated um our  

radio systems you know transmit 1.8 gigabits a  second over a thousand kilometer range from a  

radio that's a few centimeters in size to  a dish that's on the ground that we built  

ourselves that's a few meters wide somewhere  on the ground those radios are really difficult  

there's 12 subsystems of a satellite if you open  up our satellites it's like opening up your phone   you'll see these complex motherboards and and also  reaction wheels and power systems and batteries  

and compute systems and camera systems and all  that every subsystem we have pioneered to be a  

really state-of-the-art system much much better  than you can buy anything online and then just  

like apple does with its his phones you know and  then we have um integrated those into a common  

box that's really hard so they all work together  the cameras work with the reaction wheels work   with the power systems and they all work together  and then those satellites then have to work with  

the other satellites but why why why not why do  you learn that so much at nasa is it because as  
Why do you learn from NASA

opposed to working at qualcomm or working at  some other place is it is it because they're  

they they only get one shot to put it in space  and they and so they really have to go through   the precision or it's because they've got 50 years  of thinking about these hard problems like why is  

that in the water and nasa so much yeah so where i  was going with that point about all the different   steps and there's there's several more um is that  um you have pulling all those things together  

takes really thoughtful planning it doesn't  just happen this is where the agile aerospace  

sort of mantra sort of breaks down because  actually you have to plan it out at some   significant level unlike software where you  can just go well let's just keep iterating

yeah yeah that's right and the satellite has  to work the first time if it doesn't you've  

got a brick in space and and you know you have  we have to have all these circuits that enable  

us to reboot it under certain sensors and  the satellites again have to work together  

we have to have mission control systems at nasa  we would have 200 people doing controls around   every one satellite around the clock or whatever  oh my gosh we do the opposite round we have 200  

satellites controlled by one guy let's see it's  not quite like that there's a few but generally   um they're building the software that  automates the mission control rather than  

actually controlling the satellite um but but  that systems engineering takes a huge amount   of planning and a huge amount of understanding  um it's not um it's not for the faint of heart  

to plan that out and and and so very few  institutions on the planet have done that  

nasa has done that with the apollo project um  you know the the us government did it with the  

manhattan project you could argue cern has done  it with with cern there are projects like this but  

it's that kind of scale project we've undertaken a  minor apollo project we launched the largest fleet   of satellites in human history we had to put these  ground stages all around the world we had to cross  

all of this own technology ourselves and so  and we do that with a 500 person team you know  

um so it's it's a lot in the small area and our  nasa training to cut it sure enabled us to think  

through the complexities of running a such  a complex uh enabled us to undertake complex  

projects like that interesting now uh another  another kind of personal question i love the  
Favorite space movie

tom hanks series on hbo from the earth to the moon  i don't know if you've ever seen it but i i just   absolutely love that uh series is there a favorite  space movie that you have um i like star trek um  

if i i i don't often get that much time for movies  to be honest but star trek i like it's very good  

i love how they always encounter different um  cultures it's actually a philosophical program  

and people think of it as a science fiction it's  actually you know much more about morality and and  

sociology and i find that interesting as well yeah  absolutely okay cool last question we asked all of   our guests if you can go back in time what advice  do you wish you could have told your younger self  
Advice to younger self

gosh uh so many things um stick with it i mean i  have quite a lot of self intrinsic motivation but  

you know it it can i it can be tough at times when  you have a lot of people saying you can't do it  

no you can't do it no you can't  do it and it's like you have to go   is this something i've missed or  what and and stick with it you know  

um if you have in doubt um i really like what  gwen shotwell says of no arseholes policy in space  

because like half the time life's too short  absolutely people are seen anyway like  

so you know i i would i would tell myself  that um learn some lessons there um  

how do you deal like so if you find someone who  is super talented who's you know but um you know  

but but it's got a difficult personality or can  maybe treat others um in a in a way that that  

that that that you know maybe shouldn't be  tolerated like do you just like let that person  

go or do you do you say okay this person tells  you we're going to put them in a box and only   interact with them through an api or  how do you how do you think about that  

i love that interact with an api yeah you  can try that and i have and it doesn't work  

teams work together because they're teams um and  unfortunately even if somebody's wickedly talented  

in an individual contributor there's no  use if they can't work with everyone else   so i look for people that care about our mission  

who are smart and are collaborative and if you  have those three things everything else uh fits  

into place um so that's my philosophy on it  all right this has been great could you tell  

uh our world of death listeners a little bit more  about where they can find you on the internet and   sure it's quite easy it's planet.com okay  perfect that's easy all right great well  

well this has been awesome thank you so  much for being with us on world of das   how you know where is the door thanks for  joining us if you enjoyed the show consider  

leaving a review for more world of gas and that's  d-a-a-s-dash you could subscribe right here on our
