Transcript of Interview with Daria Stepanova

welcome everybody um thanks a lot Daria

for joining and taking the time out of

your super busy schedule um uh Daria is

today in Kazakhstan at a massive uh

event in the in the space Tech realm

where she has a number of um public

speaking appearances and she's taking

time out of her public schedule for us

today so thanks a lot for that

um

so what my name is Alan I'm partner with

uh partner with antler and we do this

format um once a month where every first

Wednesday of the month um I have a quick

rapid fire discussion with one of the

founders that we've been privileged

enough to to be working with um and um

where we go a little bit into um what

they're building how they're building um

and what they experience is the format

is very quick 12 minutes we'll start

with a quick intro from Daria about

herself and about the amazing ammo that

they're building we'll then have U

following that a number of Rapid Fire

questions from my side and at the end we

will open it up to um questions from the

audience um for people in the audience

please use the Q&A functionality um to

submit any questions feel free to

already start submitting your questions

as we're talking

um and then we will be picking those up

at the

end I think with that um let's go Daria

thank you so much for joining um great

to have you tell us a little bit about

kind of who you are and what is Amo and

what you

building yeah very happy to be here

thank you very much for invitation my

name is Dar I'm coo and co-founder of

hermo by my background I'm an AOSP Space

Engineer I worked in space the main for

around eight years um in my past

occupation I was building satellites and

two years um of my past occupation I was

managing the team in the CTO Ro in a

small satellite manufacturing company at

aore we are building the emissions

monitoring service to monitor methane in

CO2 leveraging the power of space

technology and microl lier and short

wave in pomet um applies to the small

satellites in particular

to track methane CO2 with high Precision

globally and near real time we're

supporting as a first customer segment

oil and gas companies to transition to

Green future faster but our we service

applications and finance Insurance Agro

forestry

domains it is indeed uh every time

amazing uh when I talk to you and the

team um because this is indeed one of

the harder problems to solve

um but you're not doing this on your own

um so tell us a little bit kind of who's

who's the team behind ammo and how how

did all of that uh come

together yeah um at the moment actually

we're already 16 team members with three

cor team Founders uh yeah our team is a

brilliant team consist of scientists

engineers um software developers that

bring together all the expertise in

Optics data processing uh satellite

engineering um the way we forms formed

the team part of the part of the coure

team met in the conference we met during

work work time while the second part of

our team came together uh yeah after

after um completing anair program to

introduction why one of the Angel

Investors yeah and right now we're where

we grew quite significantly we are

surrounded ourselves with supporters uh

yeah from Key Institute and key

technology sectors and key application

sectors and we have a very strong team

of investors together with

us that that that indeed you have um but

I mean how did you come up with the idea

I mean it's um you Incorporated the

company less than a year ago but you've

been working on this for longer than

that right um and it's not not an easy

and not a trivial idea how did all of

that come about where did the idea come

from and when did you decide okay this

this is the one and this is what I'm

going to dedicate my next 10 years plus

of my life

to right uh indeed the idea came several

years ago with a with a request from the

very promising at the m at the moment

now quite successful climate tech

company to deliver very particular data

said about meane emissions the request

um was supported by the fact that

publicly available satellite data was

not uh good enough in terms of the

quality and in quantity to deliver the

service the company was building so that

in that way the idea to build our own

that was the first um very um very first

idea we had why not to launch our own

satellites to to deliver the data sets

we need um at that moment um yeah

started researching a little bit and

figured out why this is not that

easy um and parked it uh on the idea

level the other time I met the on one of

the conferences I met my partners that

were building the instruments and it all

came together and then during on program

we were searching for someone to uh

support our commercial commercial side

of things and yeah in the end technology

and market parts came together with the

air that we indeed founded last year

awesome and kind

of you're probably probably probably

sick of uh the bad pun but uh you've

you've really been on a Rocket Ride uh

ever since um and roll Crazy Fast um and

so much has happened um but what's

what's what's been the proudest moment

in the company so

far um I hope it will be tomorrow but

we're flying our first uh pilot test

campaign of our Pilots it's both

technology verification and Market

verification so super excited about that

but what happened uh before that is um

yeah reception of the big contract from

European space agency that was yeah very

very life-changing moment um first of

all the support and Trust From The

Agency is something that gives us a lot

of confidence and credibility and helps

us a lot to to put our first mission

into space we know that we have

sufficient time and resources to build

technology really carefully yeah to

deliver the end product to the customer

so this the moment when we received the

email from the space agency that we got

accepted to the program and we're

receiving our our contract yeah was the

brightest yeah and I mean that indeed

camea came with also quite a bit of

financial support that that that really

enables you to do a lot of what you're

doing and I mean given that you

Incorporated less than a year ago the

fact that I woke up this morning with a

to a WhatsApp message with a photo of a

plane in a hanger getting ready for the

big day tomorrow uh I'm super excited

with you um totally um and kind of in I

mean we've been we've been working

together for a little over a year and a

half now um in working with antler

what's been your most valuable moment so

far uh right so

both the program I found I found very

valuable um as an engineer by identity I

had quite limited understanding on um

fundraising Works how to um how to

convert the requirements into value

proposition so for me as a as a a person

with engineering background I was very

high opening let's call it but after

after we were accepted and we passed

through through like through uh the

progr

uh further yeah support from the team

was really invaluable yeah I was very

happy that any any question any concern

I had uh yeah I could quickly quickly

text uh and yeah got my reply or advice

quite quite quickly

so summarizing the the quite a lot of

learning I received and a lot of support

from the

team yeah and looking forward to many

many great years together to come

um we have in the audience quite a few

people who are either thinking about

starting the next company with antler or

who are actually currently in in in our

residency

um working with antler what advice would

you give to Founders who are thinking

about joining

antler yeah quite many things I can I

can

share yeah first to be open to yeah new

ideas crazy ideas inter disciplinary

things try to maximize the diversity get

teaming up with people of a different

mindset different um outlook on on the

world on the management on developing so

this really brings New Perspectives and

that that's the that's the source where

new ideas come from so P push for uh

challenges and yeah really really work

on like working sticking together and

working

together

makes makes a ton of sense um with that

um let's open it up for the final three

minutes um to some Q&A from the audience

um first question that we have here um

is around the more technological

challenges that you are

facing um and kind of how are you

addressing them and and and yeah how are

you addressing

them very good question we indeed uh

have quite quite some of them espe like

our Tech team is fascinated by the

complexity of something we're building

luckily we have several senior Engineers

that have been working in the industry

for decades the combination of

young

crazy very fast engineers and experience

that comes with really senior members

like I believe it's something that

really pushes us forward plus we

surround ourselves with supporters from

yeah from different sectors different

fields that we can go to in case of

questions or concerns that can advise us

on atmospheric science Optical design

sat design levels um plus somewhere we

we um our European Space Agency project

is um really wonderful type um and we

der risked the length of this Waterfall

by paralyzing it with rapid prototyping

so the instrument that will be flying

tomorrow it's been built from commercial

the Shelf components

yeah every time I'm saying that I have

my heart like

jumping uh right so from from uh we

build it quite fast from commercial of

the shop components to learn and to Der

risk

um Maj major and the most problematic

Parts yeah

um next question here is um you've

already started talking about it a bit

but kind of what what's the state of of

the business where where do you

stand uh we're actively on one side uh

active sta stage of Technology

development we are building the main

instrument building the data processing

part in parallel we are surrounding

ourselves with Partners subcontractors

for the flight uh flight version We Are

procuring the satellite we're in contact

with with SpaceX to to get the launch

spot um on the other side we even though

our product will be in space like our

SAT will be in space quite quite late

later it's

2025 um and we'll be able to deliver the

service also from from their own we're

actively engaging with customers from

our target market verifying the value

proposition verifying the pricing and

getting getting the community of future

customers around us yeah actively

working on both both

sides and maybe and final question um

maybe run more your goes goes more to

your motivation of of building um why

did you choose to build something so

freaking hard I mean you've

been incredible in the fact that you've

gotten nor north of 5 million in kind of

financing together in the less than a

year that the company existed that kind

of enabled you to do something that is

this hard but why did you decide to go

into that and choose to build something

that hard to start with yeah very good

question um yeah I've spent pretty much

all my adult life my professional life

in doing something something similar so

I I didn't have the choice and uh yeah I

didn't know what else to do with and I'm

I'm I'm complete space nerd also so

there there's nothing else I I can do

and you're doing it extremely well thank

you so much Daria thanks a lot for

dialing in uh good luck in uh your

further Endeavors in Kazakhstan and

especially for tomorrow um I'm expecting

WhatsApp updates on on the progress of

the flight um and um yeah looking

forward to speaking very soon thank you

so much for joining thank you very much

thank you everyone

bye
